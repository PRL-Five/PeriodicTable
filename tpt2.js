    <p id="js1">The periodic table, also known as the periodic table of elements, is a tabular display of
    the chemical elements, which are arranged by atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical 
    properties. The structure of the table shows periodic trends. The seven rows of the table, called periods,
    generally have metals on the left and nonmetals on the right. The columns, called groups, contain elements
    with similar chemical behaviours. Six groups have accepted names as well as assigned numbers: for example,
    group 17 elements are the halogens; and group 18 are the noble gases. Also displayed are four simple rectangular
    areas or blocks associated with the filling of different atomic orbitals.</p>
